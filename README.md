# ha-sick-day
The HA Sick Day app is a Home Assistant App for managing automations when schedules change.

If you have automations that run daily or trigger from other typical daily schedules, those automations might need to change if your daily routine changes. Enter HA Sick Day. Did your kid get sick last night, and now you want them to sleep in and not have lights or notifications run? No problem, set a sick day. It's kind of like vacation mode for the people and areas in your Home Assistant.
